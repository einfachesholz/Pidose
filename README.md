This repository showcases the code as well as the 3d models used Pidose - our project for the RASBERRY PI 2024 competition.
Pidose.py is the code, it allows for the messages to be sent to the LCD as well as giving functions to each of the 4 buttons.
The rest of the files are 3d models that were designed and then 3d printed to be assembled by the team.
The imperial remnants folder contains everything that was used for the app to complement the Pi-dose, We could not get the app working with the raspberry pi in time however.
